## ‚ú® Features

The purpose of this code is to allow interfacing with the native BACCHUS enivroment using Python. This is NOT a version of BACCHUS written in Python, it requires an existing BACCHUS installation to function. 

There are three primary modules for this package: BACCHUS, Star, and Result.

### BACCHUS
The BACCHUS class is instantiated by giving it the location of an existing BACCHUS installation. Once a BACCHUS object is created, it will be populated with the existing state of all the primary bacchus modules:
- bsyn.com 
- babsma.com
- stellar_parameters.tab
- init.com
- elements.wln

as well as a linelists object that contains the paths to all available linelists. Each of these modules is accessible in a BACCHUS object as an attribute (e.g. init.com can be accessed by bacchus.init). This allows for editing each module in python, both through direct line-by-line editing, and a suite of preloaded methods (e.g. set_ncpu, set_linelist). MORE DOCUMENTATION COMING.

Once the configuration of BACCHUS is set up to your liking, you can write it out to the native BACCHUS. 

### Star

A Star object is the container for the stars being run in BACCHUS. At a minimum it requires a name to be instantiated, but to load into stellar_parameters.tab it will require the six necessary parameters (spectra path, teff, logg, etc...). This object will also have access to all the parameter and model information from a BACCHUS analysis, as well as the elemental abundance results (stored in a Results object).

### Results

A Results object holds all the data for a single element within a Star. It automatically scrapes the star's directory after a .abund, .eqw, or .param analysis load in the .abu, .plt, and .eqw results as Astropy Tables. 

### Running a Star

After you've configured your BACCHUS setup to your liking and written the setup to native BACCHUS, you can follow the same procedure normally used in native BACCHUS

for a BACCHUS object bacchus, and a Star object
1) bacchus.load_parameters(Star)
2) bacchus.abund(Star)
3) bacchus.eqw(Star)
4) bacchus.param(Star)


## üöÄ Installation

### From PyPI (Stable Release)
```
pip install PyBACCHUS
```

### From GitHub (Development Version)
```
# Latest development version
